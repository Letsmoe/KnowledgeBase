# Structure
Depending on what we want to show the user we need to consider certain data points we need to collect.

## Price
The price is the most important aspect of our page, the user needs to see the price immediately and shouldn't have to look for it.

## Price/Rating
The aspect of rating a product is very important in relation to the product's price since a user would want to get the most for their money.

## Market Name
A user should be displayed the market's name immediately so they know where to look for it.

## Distance
Distance to the nearest shop might be important for someone in a foreign city or country and can later be used to compare time spent when shopping in different locations.
